                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>My name is Finn Llewellyn and I wrote both the 20x3 application and this documentation website. I wrote 20x3 because after being in lockdown on and off for almost an entire year, I was spending a lot more time on my phone or computer whether it be playing games with my mates or joining online lessons for school.My eyes started to hurt after long periods of exposure and I started to research if this was a common occurrence. Long story short, it's quite common in developers so decided to write this program to remind me to take a break, and uploaded it to github so that other's could use it if they wanted to. You can find me on github <a href="https://github.com/f-llewellyn" target="_">here</a> and look at my main website <a href="fllewellyn.com" target="_">here</a>.</p>
