                <h2>Why should I use this?</h2>
                <p>Eyestrain is becoming evermore prevelant during the masses of people remaining indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whether this is for work, school, interacting with family and friends, or even if you've been binging your favourite netflix series more often than usual. This program will remind you to take a break every 20 minuites, using the 20-20-20 practice through a Windows 10 notification.</p>

                <h2>What is the 20-20-20 method?</h2>
                <p>The 20-20-20 method is a practice that many use to reduce eyestarin while looking at a digital screen. It suggests that every 20 minuites, you should focus on something roughly 20 metres away for 20 seconds. This can be a car down your road, the local park or even some hills in the distance. This also gives you an opportunity to step away from your desk and stretch your legs.</p>
